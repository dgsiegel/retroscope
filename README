README for Retroscope
---------------------

The Retroscope is a device that shows you what was happening in the past.
Think of a security camera on a time delay. Except, voluntary.

Attach a webcam to your computer and point it at the room. Set the desired time
delay, and then hit play to watch what used to be.
